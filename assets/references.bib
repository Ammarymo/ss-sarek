  abstract  = "The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the
               Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG-AMP) system for
               variant classification is score based with five classes: benign,
               likely benign, variant of unknown significance (VUS), likely
               pathogenic, and pathogenic. Here, we present a variant
               classification model that can be an add-on or alternative to
               ACMG classification: A stepwise system that can classify any
               type of genetic variant (e.g., hypomorphic alleles, imprinted
               alleles, copy number variants, runs of homozygosity, enhancer
               variants, and variants related to traits). We call it the ABC
               system because classification is first functional (A), then
               clinical (B), and optionally a standard comment that fits the
               clinical question is selected (C). Both steps A and B have 1-5
               grading when knowledge is sufficient, if not, class ``zero'' is
               assigned. Functional grading (A) only concerns biological
               consequences with the stages normal function (1), likely normal
               function (2), hypothetical functional effect (3), likely
               functional effect (4), and proven functional effect (5).
               Clinical grading (B) is genotype-phenotype focused with the
               stages ``right type of gene'' (1), risk factor (2), and
               pathogenic (3-5, depending on penetrance). Both grades are
               listed for each variant and combined to generate a joint class
               ranging from A to F. Importantly, the A-F classes are linked to
               standard comments, reflecting laboratory or national policy. In
               step A, the VUS class is split into class 0 (true unknown) and
               class 3 (hypothetical functional effect based on molecular
               predictions or de novo occurrence), providing a rationale for
               variant-of-interest reporting when the clinical picture could
               fit the finding. The system gives clinicians a better guide to
               variant significance.",
